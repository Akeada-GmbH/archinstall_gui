Profiles & Templates
====================

| Profiles is a way to install pre-defined setups.
| Imagine you have scenarios like:

 * gaming desktop
 * web server
 * chat server

| These profiles will attempt to make it easy to set up a profile for each occation.

.. note:: Currently there are only a handful of profiles, but they will be the main primary focus going forward.

| The _desktop profile will set up a generic, minimal desktop environment similar to other distributions.
| You can read more about it in the _desktop profile description, but in short it configures `Gnome`, a `webbrowser` and a `network manager`.
