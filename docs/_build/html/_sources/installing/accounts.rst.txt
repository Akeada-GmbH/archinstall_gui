Accounts
========

.. note:: In the future, it's planned that you should be able to manage one or more user accounts and groups here. For now, it's a single-user setup stage.

| Configure a standard user with a password, if you choose to, enable sudo for the user.
| The user will be created with a standard home directory under `/home` as well as belong to the `wheel` group, which ArchInstall GUI will enable for sudo permissions.

.. warning:: This *(and other)* steps will **not** configure a root password. It's there for important that you change the root password after the first successful login.
