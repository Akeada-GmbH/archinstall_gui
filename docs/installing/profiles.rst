Profiles
========

| Here you can select pre-configured setups that appeal to you, or skip this step entirely if you just want a minimal Arch Linux installation without any additional packages.
| The profiles range from `desktop` profiles with a small graphical environment to `webserver` which configures a webserver using common applications and default setups.

You can read more on the profiles them selves in the _profiles section.
