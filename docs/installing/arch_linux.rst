Arch Linux
==========

| The Arch Linux step is more a informational page to let you know when the actual operating system is installed.
| This step will install:

 * `Linux kernel <>`_
 * The `base <>`_ package
 * A `bootloader <>`_

And finally configure the bootloader for the newly installed harddrive.

.. note:: If you plan on dual-booting your system with Windows, the bootloader supports *automatic* detection of windows, there for you should **install windows first** and then the Linux OS. That way you should be able to dualboot without to much issues.
